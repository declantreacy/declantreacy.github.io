**_Pokédex No.: 27_**

**Omega Ruby:** Sandshrew's body is configured to absorb water without waste, enabling it to survive in an arid desert. This Pokémon curls up to protect itself from its enemies.

**Alpha Sapphire:** Sandshrew has a very dry hide that is extremely tough. The Pokémon can roll into a ball that repels any attack. At night, it burrows into the desert sand to sleep.

**_EXCLUSIVE TO POKÉMON MOON_**

**Sun:** It lives on snowy mountains. Its steel shell is very hard—so much so, it can't roll its body up into a ball.

**Moon:** An ancient tradition of Alolan festivals, still carried on to this day, is a competition to slide Sandshrew across ice as far as one can.
